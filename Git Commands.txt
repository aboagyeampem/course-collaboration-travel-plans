IMPORTANT
Important: make sure to include the --decorate and --all flags

The terminal application showing the results of running git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all. 
The new origin/master tracking branch now exists.

We now have a new marker in the output! This marker is origin/master and is called a tracking branch. 
A tracking branch's name includes the shortname of the remote repository as well as the name of the branch. 
So the tracking branch origin/master is telling us that the remote origin has a master branch that points to commit 9b7d28f (and includes all of the commits before 9b7d28f). 
This is really helpful because this means we can track the information of the remote Repository right here in our local one!

One very important thing to know is that this origin/master tracking branch is not a live representation of where the branch exists on the remote repository. 
If a change is made to the remote repository not by us but by someone else, the origin/master tracking branch in our local repository will not move. 
We have to tell it to go check for any updates and then it will move. We'll look at how to do this in the next section.


RECAP
The git push command is used to send commits from a local repository to a remote repository.

$ git push origin master
The git push command takes:

the shortname of the remote repository you want to send commits to
the name of the branch that has the commits you want to send


There's several things to note about running this command:

the format is very similar to that of git push - there's counting and compressing and packing of items
it has the phrase "fast-forward" which means Git did a fast-forward merge (we'll dig into this in just a second)
it displays information similar to git log --stat where it shows the files that have been changed and how many lines were added or removed in them
If you don't want to automatically merge the local branch with the tracking branch then you wouldn't use git pull you would use a different command called git fetch. You might want to do this if there are commits on the repository that you don't have but there are also commits on the local repository that the remote one doesn't have either.

Let's take a look at git fetch.

Recap
If there are changes in a remote repository that you'd like to include in your local repository, then you want to pull in those changes. To do that with Git, you'd use the git pull command. You tell Git the shortname of the remote you want to get the changes from and then the branch that has the changes you want:

$ git pull origin master
When git pull is run, the following things happen:

the commit(s) on the remote branch are copied to the local repository
the local tracking branch (origin/master) is moved to point to the most recent commit
the local tracking branch (origin/master) is merged into the local branch (master)
Also, changes can be manually added on GitHub (but this is not recommended, so don't do it).
